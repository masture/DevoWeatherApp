This repository contains the Weather App developed during the live stream of the Devopedia Engineers day celebration.
The You tube link is [Build an iOS App in an Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9K-8TIVzI)

This repo contains
* A keynote presentation explaining data flow within the App and role of SwiftUI and Combine frameworks
* The source code of the final developed App (plus minor additions).

The  App uses Open Weather Org's [Current weather by city name API](https://openweathermap.org/current#name). Please register and generate API key for yourself and replace it in WeatherService.swift file.
